    <h2>Janet Emerson Bashen</h2> 
     After many years of hard work throughout her life, entrepreneur and software developer Janet Emerson Bashen, had become the woman she is today supporting her cause for equal rights within workplaces. In 1957, Janet was born in Mansfield Ohio living with both parents before moving to Alabama and attending a fully segregated elementary school (experiencing racial divide first hand). Later on, she got a degree (of Legal Studies and Government) at Harvard University and landed a job at an insurance company that handled claims relating to equal employment opportunities, which she then proceeded to pursue and fight for. On the beginning of her journey she had gotten inspiration and started her own company (in 1994), Bashen Corporation, where she would investigate discrimination claims filed by employees. After the company grew and case numbers increased, she teamed up with her cousin to come together and build software that would help her organize all the data of cases that she had collected. This greatly assisted her in company growth, organization, and pushing cases for equality in employment. She was then able to use all of this to challenge the house of representatives in court, claiming that civil rights and employee misconduct investigations should be exempt from the Fair Credit Reporting Act and won. She was also later acknowledged as the first African American woman to earn a web-based software patent in 2006 after her software development and origin in creating the software for nalikah.
